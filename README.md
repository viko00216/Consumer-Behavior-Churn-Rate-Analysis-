## Methodology
This quantitative analysis of churn rate in e-commerce employed a comprehensive range of statistical models and techniques to investigate the intricate relationships between customer demographics, transactional data, and churn status, leveraging historical data collected from the e-commerce database, which was meticulously cleaned and processed to remove inconsistencies and missing values. The analysis utilized chi-square tests to examine the independence of categorical variables, hypothesis testing to investigate the significance of relationships between variables, and correlation analysis to measure the strength and direction of relationships between continuous variables, such as customer age and transaction value. Furthermore, logistic regression was used to model churn probability, decision trees to identify the most important factors contributing to churn, and cluster analysis to segment customers based on demographic and transactional characteristics. The results of the analysis revealed significant relationships between customer demographics, transactional data, and churn status, providing actionable insights into the drivers of churn rate. For instance, the analysis found that customers aged 25-34 were more likely to churn than customers in other age groups, and that customers who made frequent purchases were less likely to churn. Additionally, the analysis identified key factors contributing to churn, including customer dissatisfaction with product quality and poor customer service. By leveraging these insights, the e-commerce business can develop targeted retention strategies, including personalized marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and improved customer service, to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
